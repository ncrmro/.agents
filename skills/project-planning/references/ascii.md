# ASCII graph templates

Templates for every planning scenario, plus the drawing rules that keep graphs
consistent. Time always flows up: bottom = shipped, top = future, next release
on top.

Two view modes:

- **Release column** (section A) — everything drawn flat, where it lands on
  main; topology deliberately omitted. The everyday view for plans and
  reports.
- **Branch view** (sections B–D) — branches drawn as parallel vertical lanes
  beside main. Use whenever PR or milestone topology matters.

## Drawing rules

- Glyphs: `◇ ● ◉ ○`. Box-drawing characters: `│ ├ ─ ╮ ╯`.
- main is the leftmost column. Each branch is a vertical lane to the right:
  lane *n*'s glyph column is indented 2·*n* characters (`│ ◉`, `│ │ ○`).
  A stacked PR forks from its parent PR's lane and sits one lane further
  right. Messages follow their glyph after two spaces.
- A lane forks at a `├─╯` row and, once merged, closes at a `├─╮` row; the
  `├` sits on the parent column. A fork row attaches to the first commit
  below it in the parent column — that commit is the base. An open PR has
  only the fork; reading upward, its lane just ends.
- Milestone boundaries ride the milestone branch's merge row:
  `├─╮  ── milestone: <name> ──`. In the flat release column, use a bare
  `│  ── milestone: <name> ──` separator instead.
- Flagged milestones note their flag on the boundary row
  (`── milestone: <name> · flag: <flag> ──`) and draw the default-on flip as
  its own commit on main above the merge. Semantics: SKILL.md § Feature
  flags.
- Annotations (shas, PR labels, status) start at one consistent column per
  graph, two spaces past the graph's longest message row. Annotate a lane
  once, on its top commit: `PR #n  <head> → <base> · <status>`. Shipped rows
  carry the short sha instead. Optionally mark main's tip: append `← main`
  to the newest `●` row. Keep messages ≤ 50 chars (normal git subject
  discipline) so a graph fits in ~100 columns.
- Bare `│` rows only to set off regions: around release boundaries and
  between groups. No `│` row between consecutive commits in the same group.
- Release rows: `◇  vX.Y.Z (next)` for the predicted release,
  `◇  vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` once shipped. Never list the
  `chore(main): release …` commit; `◇` stands for it.

## A. Release column (the everyday minimal form)

Everything drawn as it lands on main; no branch topology.

```text
◇  v1.4.0 (next)
│
○  feat(search): fuzzy matching
○  fix(search): index rebuild on schema change
◉  feat(search): index postings table           PR #12 · in review
│
●  feat(core): extract search module            4f2a91c
●  chore: bump deps                             d81b3aa
◇  v1.3.0 — 2026-07-02
```

Read: two commits shipped since v1.3.0, one commit in review, two more
planned, and landing them all predicts v1.4.0 (the `feat`s force a minor
bump).

## B. Stacked PRs

Each deeper PR in the stack is one lane further right. A fork row lines up
with the commit it branches from: PR #2 forks from main's `feat(db): user
table`, PR #3 forks from PR #2's `token endpoint`.

```text
◇  v0.3.0 (next)
│
│ │ ○  feat(auth): session refresh  PR #3  feat/auth-ui → feat/api-tokens
│ │ ○  feat(auth): login form
│ ├─╯
│ ◉  feat(api): token endpoint      PR #2  feat/api-tokens → main · in review
├─╯
●  feat(db): user table             a1b2c3d
●  chore: scaffold                  9f8e7d6
◇  v0.2.0 — 2026-07-10
```

Stacks merge bottom-up: #2 lands first, #3 is retargeted to main and lands
after. As that happens, lanes collapse leftward: a landed lane's commits
promote to `●` and join the main column.

## C. Parallel PRs

Independent PRs, both based on main — separate lanes whose fork rows stack
above the shared base commit. Vertical order between open lanes is
deliberately meaningless: parallel work is unordered.

```text
│ ○  feat(export): csv download    PR #5  feat/export → main
├─╯
│ ◉  fix(auth): logout redirect    PR #4  fix/logout → main · in review
├─╯
●  feat(db): user table            a1b2c3d
```

When one lands, its lane collapses into the main column and the other
rebases on top.

## D. Milestones within a release

Each milestone's work is a branch lane parallel to main; the milestone
boundary is its merge row. The lower lane executes first.

```text
◇  v0.4.0 (next)
│
○  feat(billing): enable billing_v2 flag
├─╮  ── milestone: billing foundation · flag: billing_v2 ──
│ ○  feat(billing): stripe webhooks       PR #8  feat/billing → main
│ ○  feat(billing): plan model
├─╯
├─╮  ── milestone: self-serve onboarding ──
│ ○  feat(onboarding): signup wizard      PR #7  feat/onboarding → main
│ ○  feat(onboarding): invite flow
├─╯
│ ◉  feat(auth): session refresh          PR #6  feat/session → main · in review
├─╯
●  feat(auth): login form                 88c1f02
◇  v0.3.0 — 2026-07-18
```

## E. Multi-release roadmap

Stack releases only when laying out beyond the next one. Farther up = less
certain; keep distant sections coarse and flat — lanes are only worth drawing
once branches exist or stacking is decided.

```text
◇  v0.5.0 (later)
│
○  feat(billing): dunning emails
○  feat(billing): usage-based invoices
│
◇  v0.4.0 (next)
│
○  feat(onboarding): signup wizard
│ ◉  feat(api): token endpoint            PR #2  feat/api-tokens → main · in review
├─╯
●  feat(db): user table                   a1b2c3d   ← main
◇  v0.3.0 — 2026-07-10
```
